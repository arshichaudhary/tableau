Dashboard on forest fires in Canada

For making this dashboard, dataset on forest fires in Canada was used. Data contained in the dataset is from year 1970-2019 but for creating the dashoard, data is only used from 1989-2019. After cleaning is done, we have many dimension like causes of forest fire, Juristriction which is a geographical role, Protection zone(Intensive or limited), Region, Response category(full, modified, none, unspecified) and year. We also have measures like area affected by forrest fire(hectares), number and forest fire region. We have also created a number of calculated feilds to make our computations easier. 
For the dashboard, I have created 3 KPIs that calculates total fire area, extensive protection zone and percentage of fire caused by lightning. There is also a year filter which progresses from year 1989-2019, affecting our two visualizations, map and bar graph and showing dynamic data for each year. Two other visualizations are created which shows us area affected by fire for last 10 years, We can also observe that forest fire in 2014 affected 42,81,196 hectares of land which is highest for last 10 years. The last visualization is a donut chart showing causes % of forest fires.
